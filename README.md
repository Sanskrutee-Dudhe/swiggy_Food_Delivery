## Overview
This project is aimed at analyzing food delivery trends and patterns using data scraped from the Swiggy website. It involves data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and the creation of a dashboard using Power BI.
Finding the best location for opening a cloud remmote kitchen for stakeholders.


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Jupyter
- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- SQL
- Power BI Desktop
- Swiggy account (for data scraping)

## Data Collection
Use the Python scripts in the `SwiggyTable_1.ipynb` & `SwiggyTable_1.ipynb` directory to scrape data from the Swiggy website. Make sure to configure the scripts with your Swiggy account credentials.

## Data Cleaning
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `Insights.ipynb` directory to clean and preprocess the collected data. Perform any necessary data transformations and handle missing values.

## Data Analysis
In the same Jupyter notebooks,SQL conduct data analysis to derive insights and trends from the cleaned data. Visualize your findings using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

## Dashboard
The final step of the project involves creating a dashboard using Power BI. You can find the Power BI files and resources in the `Swiggy Dashboard` directory. Import these files into Power BI Desktop and customize the dashboard as needed.



## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data from Swiggy. The insights gained from this analysis can be used to make data-driven decisions related to find the preferences for location to open remote kitchen, also to find the price differences in cuisines, and more.

Feel free to explore the code and reports in this repository for a deeper understanding of the project.
