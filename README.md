## 🔍Analysis Process

Our analysis process encompassed two crucial components:

**1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   We initiated our analysis by thoroughly exploring the collected data, identifying and addressing any inconsistencies or missing values. This step ensured that our data was reliable and ready for deeper analysis.

**2. Correlation Analysis:**
   We delved into the relationships between variables, particularly exploring correlations between restaurant attributes and customer ratings. This step helped identify patterns and factors influencing customer satisfaction.

**3. Visualization:**
    To make the data more accessible, we employed data visualization techniques, including graphs and charts. Visualization enhanced our understanding of trends and provided clear insights for decision-making.

**4.Interactive Dashboard:**
   To present our findings effectively, we created an interactive dashboard that showcased key insights and recommendations. This user-friendly interface allowed for easy exploration of the data and insights.
   
These analyses shed light on results into meaningful insights and recommendations. These findings serve as a resource for making informed decisions in the food delivery industry and optimizing strategies for future success.

## 💡Primary Insights

Our analysis yielded the following key insights:

### 🏷️Delivery Time and Customer Ratings
- There is a limited correlation between delivery time and customer ratings. However, it's noteworthy that top-rated restaurants typically maintain an average delivery time of around 30 minutes.

### 🏷️Strategic Location:
- The project's recommendation to establish a remote kitchen strategically located between Koramangala, Indiranagar, and Ashok Nagar capitalizes on high customer concentration in these areas. This central location reduces delivery times, enhances operational efficiency, and fosters customer loyalty.

### 🏷️Market Balance
- Serving customers from all three areas ensures a balanced market presence, mitigating the risk of losing customers to competitors exclusively located in one area.

These insights are valuable for optimizing restaurant strategies and enhancing customer experiences in the food delivery market.
